JBCoreDataAgent
===============

JBCoreDataAgent is meant to be an abstract class used to create subclasses to interface with a specific datamodel. JBCoreDataAgent can technically be used generically, but I do not think this would be the best use of it.

#### Need to add
* More helpers for adding, editing and deleting entities.
* Configure batch size in the fetchedResultsController.
